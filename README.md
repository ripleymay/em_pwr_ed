☐ Introduction: 
Welcome to emPWRed.  Built with the freedom to create your lifestyle the way you intended. 
PWR's vision is to inspire you with the best solutions you thought you never knew you needed.
Let us introduce the six pillars of balance and wellness.  In order to perform and manage your day-to-day life, you get to choose which activity you want to log and decide what fits in the six pillars to choose from.  You can then decide to look at an activity's details in order to analyze the radial charts we create for you in order to visualize those pillars clearly.  Bottom line, we got you covered and we want to ensure the best versions of YOU possible!

☐ FUTURE UPDATES:
Next Step(11/11/21):

- PWR member: Will wants to polish more of the CSS and add several other features such as a goal setting portion so users can see if they're meeting their goals.
- PWR member: Paolo wants to update more of the CSS in the about page while maintaining a minimalist style.
