☐ Introduction: 
Welcome to EMPWR.  Built with the freedom to create your lifestyle the way you intended. 
PWR's vision is to inspire you with the best solutions you thought you never knew you needed.
Let us introduce the six pillars of balance and wellness.  In order to perform and manage your day-to-day life, you get to choose which activity you want to log and decide what fits in the six pillars to choose from.  You can then decide to look at an activity's details in order to analyze the radial charts we create for you in order to visualize those pillars clearly.  Bottom line, we got you covered and we want to ensure the best versions of YOU possible!
